For this who are acquantied with the practice of managing a position or multiple positions for that matter, a stop loss or limit sell order is not unfamiliar. These are market orders put in place to create "boundaries" around the performance of an asset in a portfolio. The latter of these two, the limit sell, is also known as the "take profit" as such type of order will trigger the selling of a stock once it reaches a desired price level. Conversely, the stop loss as the name implies is a market order put in place as a form of insurance for the speculator as to buffer themselves from losses greater than what they could handle. As such, the stop loss will exectue the sell of a stock if the price goes down to a certain level the speculator would like to take no more greater loss at.
